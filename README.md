# RangeMap
RangeMap is an extension of Javaâ€™s Linked HashMap that takes a range of numeric values as a key and a singular Object as a value. RangeMap.get() is written to allow any key/value pair within a range to be searched by reference, even if they haven't been explicitly created or stored in memory.

The RangeMap has several use-cases where a numeric range needs to point to a singular object or value.  When working with ranges in data, this allows the user to simulate and reference billions of key/value pairs at comparable efficiency to any other HashMap type.  It can also save system memory for cases where system memory is limited.  If the ranges in a RangeMap instance are in intervals of 1000, the storage size of the collection would be ~1000x smaller than an equivalent set of key/value pairs.

DEMONSTRATION INSTRUCTIONS

1.	create run configuration for 'Driver.java' and run program.

2.	Follow prompts in command line for demonstrations of the RangeMap package.




RANGEMAP CLASS INSTRUCTIONS (not needed for running demo)

1. Create a class and make sure ARange, RangeKey and RangeMap are in the same directory, or imported into your project.

2. Instantiate a new RangeMap object and add your range start, range end, and the value or object you want that range of numbers to point to.

3. Use RangeMap.get() to get your value from any number inside the range-key, and any key in the RangeMap.

As per the example in step 2, the rangemap will return a value of 1 since it is the assigned value for any key from 1000 to 2000.



For Help, reference the RangeMap.Java doc comments, which outline every aspect of the Collection in detail.
